					My college campus is the place where I spend most of my day times. I love that place a lot and I have lots of friends there. Whenever we get leisure time in the college period, we hang out on the campus. There is a big college canteen where we get every type of food. The entire campus has around ten buildings. Each building is having own department. There is a friendly environment in the campus and anyone can go to any building, there is not any restriction. This is a very good and amazing place to spend time. I love my campus a lot.
